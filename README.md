### 👋

I know I can be 🐌  &nbsp;responding to issues at times, but I care deeply about [open source](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q39162) and will never completely leave a project without handing it over to someone or archiving it properly! (Unless the bus takes me, of course)
Ping me if it takes too long. You can also reach me easily on Twitter [@danmichaelo](https://twitter.com/danmichaelo) or good ol' electronic mail!
I work in the [librarysphere](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q856625), where there's not… an abundance of developers, so I'm generally always interested in collaborations 🤗
